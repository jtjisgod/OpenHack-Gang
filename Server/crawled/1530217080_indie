you for helping me become a better person\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/mxmtoon\n\nproduced, mixed by colliding with mars\ncomposition by colliding with mars and mxmtoon\nlyrics, cover art by colliding with mars\n\nlyrics:\nI always feel as though I’m nothing more than just a shell\nthese incessant self reminders make my life a living hell\nif only I could be somebody else for just today\nmaybe all of my small insecurities would slip away\nI could analyze and pick apart what makes me who I am\nthen I’ll reconstruct the good in me and make a better man\nmaybe one who isn’t lazy or as scatterbrained at that \nor maybe I’ll just sit alone and continue being sad \n\ncomplacency is key if you should recreate the past \nfirst you start with all your mistakes \nfollowed suit with bitter laughs\nonce you’ve successfully stretched yourself beyond so very thin\nyou can reap the seed you sow and never be comfortable and your own skin\n\nI know that you’ll never hear this but I’m sorry for the person that I used to be \nI’d like to think I’ve changed\n\nI look like hell\nI feel like hell\nJesus I should be in hell\n\nI wake to see that my friends aren’t talking anymore\nit’s insatiable, my longing to just be with them once more\nbut times will change, it’s silly to think friends will stick around \ntimes will change it’s silly to think friends will stick around\nI always feel as though it’s like I’m running from the past\nmy imaginative outbursts, killing kings with slight of hand\nthe bridges I have burned from all the shitty things I did\nbut now I know I’ve made my bed and I’m the one who lies in it\n\nI’m sorry for the person that I used to be \nI’d like to think I’ve changed\nbut the person that I used to be has come back to kill me\n\nI look like hell\nI feel like hell\nJesus I should be in

Following a self-released split single, the band now announces their signing to Brooklyn-based label Good Eye Records and their forthcoming debut EP.\n\nAlthough the name may be new, the seeds of The Rareflowers were sown as early as 2013. Jimmy and Kane had left their previous band to join Aaron, who had also left his band, to experiment with multitrack cassette recording.\n\nFlash forward to 2016 and The Rareflowers, performing under a different name, meet Matthew Molnar (Friends, Kissing Is A Crime) at New Brunswick basement show. Molnar would prove integral in the production of the EP with mixing done by Jarvis Taveniere of Woodsist Records. Born from the spirit of this newly formed partnership, The Rareflowers are already at work on a follow-up LP.\n\nStay tuned for more from The Rareflowers and be sure to follow them on their social outlets. \"The Rareflowers\" is out June 29th and is the seventh release from Good Eye Records.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"download_url":null,"duration":188726,"full_duration":188726,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Rock","has_downloads_left":true,"id":461907696,"kind":"track","label_name":"Good

I immediately got angry because I haven't written a song that was this good yet. But if anything, it also pushed me to get the EP done. It didn't discourage me. I really love the lyrics to this song, so I got this done over the course of a day. I'd figure I would put this out now to get more content out there before Friday. This is my favorite band, and I really do love the shit out of this song. It hits way too close to home, right at my existential crisis. I hope I did them justice.\n\nYou learn a couple things when you get to my age\nLike friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark\nWhen your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times\nYou're getting spiritually enlightened at 29\n\nSo just give yourself a try\nWon't you give yourself a try?\nWon't you give yourself a try?\nWon't you give?\n\nI found a grey hair in one of my zoots\nLike context in a modern debate I just took it out\nThe only apparatus required for happiness \nis your pain and fucking going outside\nAnd getting STD's at 27 really isn't the vibe\nJane took her own life at 16\nShe was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm\nAnd I was 25 and afraid to go outside\nA millenial that baby-boomers like\n\nWon't you give yourself a try?\nWon't you give yourself a try?\nWon't you give yourself a try?\nWon't you give?\n\n'And what would you say to your younger self?'\nGrowing a beard's quite hard\nAnd whiskey never starts to taste nice\nAnd you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny\n'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs\nAnd spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online\nSo just give yourself a try\nWon't you give yourself a try?\nWon't you give yourself a try?\nWon't you give?\n\nSongwriters: Adam Brian Thomas Hann / George Bedford Daniel / Matthew Timothy Healy / Ross Stewart MacDonald\nGive Yourself A

taken so much time to realise\n\nThat the way I trust was the way I fell\nAnd the way I loved just gave you hell\nThese words I used before were all white lies\n\nNow I’m crossing open oceans past the seas\nAnd I’m struggling to face these facts and I’m on my knees\nThat we’re older now and time is never ours to keep, or ours to cheat\nThat light will die before your eyes\n\nNo, I don’t wanna take time\n‘Cause it’s keeping me from burying the inside.\nAnd you, don’t want another lie,\nBecause I’m so high up but I’m falling on the outside.\n\nThe distancing and space I craved\nWas hiding you from all those ways I \nLet all these obsessions play with me\n\nAvoiding fear with fight or flight\nMy thinking was all black and white\nI tried so hard to find some clarity\n\nBut now ahead is clearer, I can see (my mind’s not what it used to be)\nAnd I’m walking this direction to be free (I’ve taken time to show you what I mean)\nAnd all I ask is those I meet, to see my life as incomplete\nAnd let me write the rest from the debris\n\n‘Cause, I don’t wanna take time\n‘Cause it’s keeping me from burying the inside.\nAnd you, don’t want another lie,\nBecause I’m so high up but I’m falling on the outside.\nAnd I, just need to find\nAnother state of mind to keep myself up high\nAnd we, we live to strive\nSo I’m taking back control of my own life\n\nAnd I know that I can’t tell you why\nBut I have to change to make this all seem, real\nI have to walk alone this time\nI have to pass the people queueing\nFor another ticket to the never ending sky\n\nI don’t wanna take time\n‘Cause it’s keeping me from burying the inside.\nAnd you, don’t want another lie,\nBecause I’m so high up, and I’m falling on the outside.\nAnd I, just need to find\nAnother state of mind to keep myself up high\nAnd we, we live to strive\nSo I’m taking back control of my own life\n_____________________________________________________\n\nWords and music subject to copyright.

they ask how it feels what can I say\nI’d love to say I cope in my own way\nBut I don’t know\nI’m not down\nNah I’ve hardly been here\nSafe in the fog\nI’ve been smothered\nI’ve been safe from all fear\n\nWhen you saw my eyes\nWhat did you think\nDid you see any love\nBehind those blinks\nI don’t understand\nI’d be glad\nIf you were great as they say\nBefore I could see\nYou had to go\nAnd pass away\n\nI’m sure you’re better off\nBut there’s nothing better ‘bout it\nAnd like they said there’s nought I could have done\nWhat did I do\nWhat did we say\nWhy did you leave\n\nI know you’re better off\nBut there’s nothing happy ‘bout it\nAnd I just feel it’s only you to blame\nSo get out my head\nGet out my heart\nStay in your grave\n\nMaybe I’m not quite right\nI’ll concede a little lost\nI’m still trying to settle\nAll this flying dust\nCus you sure left in a wind\nTook the whole kin, for spin\nSeems we’re still stuck somewhere\nOver in the past\n\nAnd I’m sure you knew the pen\nCouldn’t you have left a note\nNot a bible\nBut a thin coat, for the cold\nOh mama I’ve been growing old\nAll my demons growing bold\nCouldn’t you have left a searchlight\nFor the dark\n\nCus when they ask how it feels what can I say\nI’d love to say that I coped in my own way\nBut I don’t know\nI’m not sad\nNah I’ve hardly been here\nSafe in the smog\nI’ve been smothered\nI’ve been safe from all

say about a wound that never healed\nCus to be frank\nI’ve felt nothing\nNo I’ve never been clear\nDown in the mist I’ve been strangled\nI’ve been choked in the fear\n\nWhen you took that final breath what did you see\nAny sisters, your own daughter, maybe me\nWere you sorry, were you happy\nWere you finally clean\nWas it the peace\nYou were hoping you could

It was released on 11 May 2018 through the Domino Recording Company, following up AM (2013). It is produced by frequent Arctic Monkeys collaborator James Ford and band frontman Alex Turner.

Buy here: https://birthdeathrec.bandcamp.com\n\nAt last available, the first flash of Luke Lund's songwriting project Mind/Body, and new imprint Birthdeath. \"Nothing Else Fills\" EP spits out 21 minutes of bleak drone rock riddled with deeply personal mortality dread, love, sense of inadequacy and guilt, all the while clinging to an inherent weight and paradoxically reprieving air of malaise. \n\nThe split single song \"Transient\" is expanded to a digital EP, and the opener channels existential panic with an amalgamation of phlegmatic slowcore slouch of Codeine and waves of sinister trippiness by early industrial Godflesh or Skullflower. \n\nThe burly \"Negative Midas Touch\" blazes with ten minutes of bowed free-form guitar and towering bass. This unreleased b-side pieces together elements of kraut psychedelia with improvised Mellotron and dub with a drum machine shattered into bits. \n\nScheduled to be released last year and bogged by technical setback, the EP also includes a crunched out version of the blaring \"Fault Less\" which took a head start on Terranean Recordings. The dreamy shoegaze tinged song swaps the low end to a rolling bass synth. \n\n\"We do not live, we only lead a semblance of life; we can only think of how to keep from dying, and our whole life is a death worship.\" -

closer to the fallout\n\nAnd I can’t save you\nI can’t save you\n\nI know it wouldn't work, but I forgive your words\nI don’t want to fight bad decisions\nLiving for my sadder visions \nPretend that

and so confused?\nGuess I better get on with my flower video\nWe're all life designers so I'm working on my logo\nPretending that they care, but everybody's going solo\nTrying to love what you got,

- Fires (mp3) - Out now\n\nMETHODS are a Wolverhampton/Salford based, five piece who create a sound that can only be described as dark electro indie. \n\nInfluences are drawn from the likes of Joy Division, Depeche Mode, Primal Scream, Editors, Interpol and any other music that catches the creative ear of METHODS.\n\nFormed in 2015 after a mutual need to create something special and meaningful. Ash Bradley - Vocals, Jon Nash - Synths, Ryan Deakin - Guitar, Adam Hall - Bass and Pete Bates - Drums. \n\nNot ones to follow the crowd METHODS produce a mixture of dark, gritty rhythms with a good helping of uplifting synths and guitars, topped off with some of the best lyrics around.\n\n2017 saw the band solidify their sound playing a number of gigs testing it out and unleashing METHODS to the world, the response has been good and momentum is gaining. \n\nThe band released their first single ‘Sanctuary’ in August 2017, recorded with the legendary producer Gavin Monaghan at Magic Garden Studios. \n\nDuring December they supported The Twang on their 10th Anniversary Love It When I Feel Like This Tour. \n\nMost recently their music has been used by Wolverhampton Wanders FC on goal of the month and heard by thousands of people.\n\n2018 is set for much bigger and better things. The band are constantly writing and recording new material and are currently working towards their next single release. \n\nMETHODS are the hardest working band around and 2018 is their year.\n\n\n“Fires, is a song about the break up of a relationship. About two people who have been together for a long time, growing a part. One side is a dominant person, and controlling. The other side wants to be loved. Both using actions to show there feelings, instead of speaking to each other. Thoughts get locked away. The only way for them both to move forward is for it all to end.” Ash (singer)\n\n\nBand live dates\n\nSat 21st July \t- \tActress & Bishop - Rebel against cancer - Birmingham\nSat 18th Aug \t-

by Shawn Ames\nCopyright (C) Number 9 Productions 2018\n\nThis song is what started me on the path on furthering an education in sound recording. It was the project I turned in as my final to pass a class at Washburn University called \"Adventures in Acoustic and Electronic Music recording\" in 1985. This song impressed the teacher and it was the only true A-grade I ever got that was easy. The keyboard was a Yamaha DX7 recorded on a 2 track reel to reel tape. The saxaphone solo was played by someone I pulled out of the hallway. He sat and heard it once, practised it once, and then we recorded it. After the class was over I attended classes at City Spark recording studio in Kansas City, Kansas back when music was recorded on large magnetic tape.","downloadable":true,"download_count":0,"download_url":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/461970438/download","duration":272220,"full_duration":272220,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Indie","has_downloads_left":true,"id":461970438,"kind":"track","label_name":"Number 9 Productions/Mad Dog Records","last_modified":"2018-06-22T17:37:47Z","license":"all-rights-reserved","likes_count":3,"permalink":"candles-incense-and-you-1985","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/shawn-ames/candles-incense-and-you-1985","playback_count":31,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":461970438,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:461970438","artist":"Shawn Ames","album_title":"Music from the Vault: 1985 - 2018","writer_composer":"Shawn Ames"},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":"2018-06-22T00:00:00Z","reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"Indie Rock\" \"Shawn Ames\" \"Topeka Kansas\" \"Backlash Kansas\"","title":"Candles, Incense, and You (1985)","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/461970438","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:461970438","user_id":27791916,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wis.sndcdn.com/Vmyx9GQcyT9T_m.json","display_date":"2018-06-22T17:37:47Z","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000320610292-8bwux7-large.jpg","first_name":"Shawn","full_name":"Shawn Ames","id":27791916,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2018-06-22T17:37:47Z","last_name":"Ames","permalink":"shawn-ames","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/shawn-ames","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/27791916","urn":"soundcloud:users:27791916","username":"Shawn Ames","verified":false,"city":"Topeka","country_code":"US"}},"score":3.864923123758844},{"track":{"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000365318553-oh23ln-large.jpg","commentable":true,"comment_count":null,"created_at":"2018-06-26T11:02:00Z","description":"www.PureHoneyMagazine.com\n\nCHAMPAGNE SUPERCHILLIN’\u0003 'Amor Fati'\nSPAM ALLSTARS\u0003 'Trans-Oceanic'\nSONIC GRAFFITI '\u0003Ghost of Betrayal'\nUNSANE\u0003 'Factory'\nJOHAN DANNO\u0003 'Rescue Me'\nHELL & HOLLAR '\u0003Desert Dust'\nINDIGO DREAMERS\u0003 'Where Have You Been'\u0003\nBORZOI\u0003 'Machine (Live from Houndstooth)'\nTHE DEADLY BLANK\u0003 'So Hard'\nREELS '\u00032825 (Live from Houndstooth)'\n\nPromotional Compilations for PUREHONEY MAGAZINE\nWe have absolutely no interest or desire to share anyone's music without their consent.\nIn each and EVERY case, we have contacted either the artist and/or a representative (publicist, label, manager, etc) and have been granted permission to make their chosen song promotionally available as a free download for our audience.

woke up and looked around\nHe saw no one and heard no sound\nA dragonfly sat on his bed\nAnd told him please do not forget\n \nI am the king in this Wonderland\nI will stay with you until the end\nWithout me here you'll lose your soul\nIt will be sucked into that ozone hole\n \nChorus:\nFred just blinked  his eyes and shook his head\nHe could not believe what the King just said\nHe really wanted to keep his soul\nAnd retain some sense of selfcontrol\nAm I losing touch with reality?\nHow do I keep my dignity?\n  \nA crocodile flew in the sky\nAnd asked him \"Do you know why\nAll the birds just stare at me\nThat's not really fair you see?\"\n \nI have no beak and my wings are smalln\nBut I've got the biggest tail of all\nThe King replied \"Just show your teeth\"\n\"That will teach them to believe\"\n \nChorus\n \nA monkey appeared from below the ground\n\"You will not believe what I just found\"\nThe moles below now claim they see\nThat most of us are not really free!\"\n \n\"They will emerge from down below\nAnd they will command our King to go!\"\nThe King had no intend to liberate\n\"Them stupid moles just sealed their fate!\"\n \nChorus\n \nThe dragonfly now turned to Fred\nThis may be the first time that we met\nBut I really could use your help right now\nI would like to ask you to go below\n \nTake this gun and kill them moles\nJust bury them inside their holes\nWe can take them by surpise\nThey will no longer spread their
